# Web Crawling news articles + ChatGPT + NLP

The project aims to collect, analyze, and extract valuable insights from news articles, helping organizations make more informed decisions and anticipate market trends.

ðŸ’» Developed in Python, the project utilizes a web crawler to extract news from the AgÃªncia Brasil website (which was used as a pilot). The collected news articles are then automatically summarized by ChatGPT using its API. After processing, the information is saved in a tabular Excel file to facilitate access to the generated insights.

ðŸ“Š Furthermore, the project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with packages like TextBlob, NLTK, and spaCy for sentiment analysis of news content and identifying and analyzing keyword frequency. These analyses are crucial for identifying relevant topics and emerging patterns.
